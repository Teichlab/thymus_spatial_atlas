# In this folder we provide 2 simple examples of visiumator preprocessing and TissueTag annotations which includes: 
1) 5K image extraction
2) fiducial detection and affine allignment
3) otsu thresholding
4) TissueTag annotation
5) Annotation transfer to visium (h5ad) object

* note the reference datasets (found here - https://github.com/Teichlab/thymus_spatial_atlas/tree/main/ImageSpot/visiumator/reference_data ) are requiered for visiumator preprocessing
